## How SCOUT Works

SCOUT processes information locally on your device:

1. **Content Analysis**: The extension analyzes the content of webpages you visit (titles, headings, descriptions) to provide relevant AI tool recommendations.

2. **Search Query Monitoring**: On Google search pages, the extension monitors your search queries to provide contextual recommendations.

3. **Local Processing**: All analysis and matching happens entirely within your browser using a local database of AI tools. No data leaves your device.

4. **No External Communication**: The extension does not make any network requests, API calls, or communicate with external servers.

SCOUT requests the following permissions:

- **`sidePanel`**: To display recommendations in Chrome's side panel interface
- **`tabs`**: To identify the active tab and enable the side panel functionality
- **Host permissions (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`)**: To analyze webpage content and provide contextual recommendations

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and do not involve data collection or transmission.

## Data Storage
